CHANGELOG
=========

0.3.0 - 2026-01-02
------------------

Add secure account linking for social authentication providers.

**New features:**

- Configurable `account_linking` settings:
  - `enabled`: Enable/disable account linking (required for both manual and automatic linking)
  - `allow_different_emails`: Allow linking accounts with different emails
- Manual account linking via `response_type=link_code` flow
- Automatic account linking by email during login

**Security improvements:**

- Fail fast at authorize time if linking is disabled (better UX)
- Email verification checks for untrusted providers
- Link codes are bound to the user who initiated the flow

0.2.0 - 2025-12-23
------------------

Add `id_token` field to `TokenResponse` for OpenID Connect support. This optional field holds the ID token returned alongside the access token in OIDC flows.

0.1.3 - 2025-12-23
------------------

This release adds missing `__init__.py` files

0.1.2 - 2025-12-23
------------------

# GitHub provider: fallback to username when name is not set

Some GitHub users don't have a display name configured on their profile. Previously, this would result in `name` being `null` in the user info. Now, we fall back to using the GitHub username (`login`) when `name` is not set, ensuring users always have a display name.

0.1.1 - 2025-11-24
------------------

Initial release
